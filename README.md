Create a score keeping webpage using DOM manipulation and JavaScript events.

Create three buttons Player 1, Player2, and Reset.

Create a drop down selection to choose the highest score you want to play to.

Display the score for Player1 and Player 2

When one of the players reach the "play to" score, the buttons will no longer tally the score
and the winning score turns green and the losing score turns red. 

Press reset button to start a new game.
